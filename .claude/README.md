# Claude Code Settings

This directory contains Claude Code configuration for the Loom project.

## Files

- **`settings.json`**: Team-wide permissions and settings (committed to git)
- **`settings.local.json`**: Personal preferences (gitignored, create if needed)
- **`../.mcp.json`**: MCP server configuration (at project root, committed to git)
- **`agents/`**: Custom subagent definitions for Loom roles (see below)

## Pre-approved Commands

The `settings.json` file pre-approves common development commands to streamline the AI workflow:

### GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- PR operations: create, edit, view, list, checkout, diff, review, checks
- Issue operations: create, edit, view, list, close
- Workflow runs: view

## Local Overrides

Create `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal preferences:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(your custom command:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Local settings override team settings for that specific configuration key.

## MCP Servers

The project includes two MCP servers configured in `.mcp.json`:

### loom-logs
Monitor Loom application logs:
- `tail_daemon_log` - View daemon logs (`~/.loom/daemon.log`)
- `tail_tauri_log` - View Tauri app logs (`~/.loom/tauri.log`)
- `list_terminal_logs` - List terminal output files
- `tail_terminal_log` - View specific terminal output

### loom-terminals
Interact with Loom terminal sessions:
- `list_terminals` - List all active terminals
- `get_terminal_output` - Read terminal output
- `get_selected_terminal` - Get current terminal info
- `send_terminal_input` - Execute commands in terminals

### loom-ui
Interact with the Loom application UI and state:
- `read_console_log` - View browser console output (JavaScript errors, console.log statements)
- `read_state_file` - Read current application state (.loom/state.json)
- `read_config_file` - Read terminal configurations (.loom/config.json)
- `trigger_start` - Trigger workspace start with confirmation dialog (factory reset with 6 terminals)
- `trigger_force_start` - Trigger force start without confirmation (immediate reset)

**Label State Machine Reset**: When workspace is started (via `trigger_start` or `trigger_force_start`), the `reset_github_labels` Tauri command automatically resets the GitHub label state machine:
- Removes `loom:building` from all open issues (workers can reclaim them)
- Replaces `loom:reviewing` with `loom:review-requested` on all open PRs (reviewer can re-review)
- This ensures a clean state when restarting the workspace with fresh agent terminals

**Note**: When you first open the project, Claude Code will prompt you to approve these MCP servers. You can also enable them automatically by setting `"enableAllProjectMcpServers": true` in your `.claude/settings.local.json`.

## Slash Commands

The `commands/` directory contains slash commands that define Loom roles. Each command file contains the complete role definition - there's no indirection to separate role files.

### Available Commands

| Command | Role | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `/builder` | Builder | Implements features for `loom:issue` issues and creates PRs |
| `/judge` | Judge | Reviews PRs with `loom:review-requested` label |
| `/curator` | Curator | Enhances issues and marks them as `loom:curated` |
| `/architect` | Architect | Creates architectural proposals with `loom:architect` |
| `/hermit` | Hermit | Identifies bloat and creates simplification issues |
| `/doctor` | Doctor | Addresses PR feedback and resolves conflicts |
| `/guide` | Guide | Triages issues and applies `loom:urgent` to top 3 |
| `/champion` | Champion | Auto-merges approved PRs with `loom:pr` label |
| `/loom help` | Help | Comprehensive help guide with sub-topics (roles, workflow, commands, etc.) |

### How Slash Commands Work

**Manual Invocation**: Use slash commands to assume a role:
```bash
/builder    # Assume Builder role, find and implement a loom:issue
/judge      # Assume Judge role, review a PR with loom:review-requested
/loom help  # Show comprehensive Loom help guide
```

Each slash command contains the complete role definition, including:
1. The role's purpose and responsibilities
2. Workflow guidelines and label transitions
3. Instructions for completing ONE iteration of the role's task

### Agent Roles in Workflow

The roles work together following the label-based workflow:

1. **architect** scans codebase → creates proposals with `loom:architect`
2. **User approves** → adds `loom:issue` label
3. **curator** enhances issues → marks as `loom:curated`
4. **User approves** → adds `loom:issue` label
5. **guide** prioritizes → adds `loom:urgent` to top 3
6. **builder** implements → creates PR with `loom:review-requested`
7. **judge** reviews → approves or requests changes
8. **doctor** fixes feedback → transitions back to `loom:review-requested`
9. **User merges** → issue auto-closes

### Creating Custom Commands

To create a custom slash command:

1. Create `.claude/commands/your-command.md` (or `.claude/commands/your-namespace/command.md`) with the complete role definition
2. Include role purpose, workflow guidelines, and iteration instructions
3. Use it with `/your-command` (or `/your-namespace/command`)

**Note**: `.loom/roles/` contains symlinks to `.claude/commands/loom/` for Tauri App compatibility. The single source of truth for all Loom role definitions is `.claude/commands/loom/`.

## Custom Subagents

The `agents/` directory contains custom subagent definitions for Loom roles. These subagents can be used with Claude Code's Task tool for spawning role-specific agents with fresh context.

### Available Subagents

| Subagent | Model | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `loom-shepherd` | sonnet | Single-issue lifecycle orchestration (Layer 1) |
| `loom-daemon` | sonnet | System orchestration, work generation (Layer 2) |
| `loom-builder` | opus | Implement features and fixes |
| `loom-judge` | opus | Review pull requests |
| `loom-curator` | sonnet | Enhance and organize issues |
| `loom-doctor` | sonnet | Fix bugs and address PR feedback |
| `loom-champion` | sonnet | Evaluate proposals, auto-merge PRs |
| `loom-architect` | opus | Create architectural proposals |
| `loom-hermit` | sonnet | Identify simplification opportunities |
| `loom-guide` | sonnet | Prioritize and triage issues |
| `loom-auditor` | sonnet | Verify runtime behavior of built software |

### How Subagents Work

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that run in their own context window. Each has:
- Custom system prompt referencing the role definition in `.loom/roles/`
- Specific tool access appropriate for the role
- Model selection optimized for the task complexity

**Using Subagents with Task**:

The Loom Shepherd (or daemon) can spawn subagents for each phase:

```python
# Spawn builder subagent with fresh context
# Note: subagent_type is always "general-purpose" - role selection
# happens via the slash command in the prompt (e.g., "/builder 123")
result = Task(
    description="Builder phase for issue #123",
    prompt="/builder 123",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    run_in_background=False
)
```

**Benefits**:
- **Fresh context**: Each subagent starts clean, avoiding context pollution
- **Role isolation**: Subagents focus on their specific task
- **Cost control**: Use faster/cheaper models for simpler roles (sonnet vs opus)
- **Better observability**: Clear which role is running

### Subagents vs Slash Commands

| Feature | Slash Commands | Subagents |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Context | Shared with main conversation | Isolated, fresh context |
| Invocation | `/builder 123` | `Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="/builder 123")` |
| Use case | Manual orchestration | Automated orchestration |
| Visibility | In main conversation | Spawned as separate task |

**Use slash commands** for manual orchestration mode where you want direct control.
**Use subagents** for automated orchestration where shepherds coordinate roles with fresh context per phase.
